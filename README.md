## OpenHPC Component Submissions

The OpenHPC Technical Steering Committee (TSC) welcomes community requests for new
software additions for integration within future releases, and this repository
is used to facilitate and track submissions.  

**Process Overview**: New component requests from community submitters will be
reviewed on a periodic, rolling basis (starting at a minimum of a quarterly
frequency).  Interested submitters can begin the process by creating a new
issue on this submission repository (or click
[here](https://github.com/openhpc/submissions/issues/new) to begin).  A
complete summary of the elements required for each submission is shown in an example
[issue](https://github.com/openhpc/submissions/issues/1) and includes a variety
of details including (but not limited to):

* Name, public URL
* Technical overview
* Brief explanation/justification for submission
* Open-source license type
* Software dependencies
* Availability of test collateral

Once submitted, a review by members of the TSC will be scheduled during the
next review cycle with results publicly summarized on the Submissions Wiki
site.  The TSC endeavors to obtain a minimum of 5 reviews for each component
from a variety of TSC members.  Each new component requested will receive a
selection notification categorization as follows:

* Accept
* Accept with changes
* Reject until changes
* Reject

Accepted components will be scheduled for a future OpenHPC release and
maintainers will collaborate with submitters as appropriate to finalize the
integration.
